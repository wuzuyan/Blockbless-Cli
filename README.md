# Blockless CLI
The Blockless CLI is a command line tool that makes it easy to interact with the Blockless Network and build and manage your applications. 

With the Blockless CLI, you can connect to the network via your on-chain identity, construct a local worker environment with one click, and build, test, deploy, and monitor your projects in real time.

## Installation
With `curl`:

```sh
sudo sh -c "curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlocklessNetwork/cli/main/download.sh | bash"
```

Or with `wget`:

```sh
sudo sh -c "wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlocklessNetwork/cli/main/download.sh -v -O download.sh; chmod +x download.sh; ./download.sh; rm -rf download.sh"
```

To install on Windows, go to the [releases page](https://github.com/blocklessnetwork/cli/releases) on GitHub and download the x86 version of the Blockless CLI. Currently, the Windows ARM64 version is not supported.

## Usage

To use the BLS CLI, open a terminal and run `bls` followed by the command you want to use. The command structure is as follows:

```sh
bls [command] [subcommand]
```

For example, to connect to the Blockless Network, you can run the `bls login` command:

```sh
bls login
```

Alternatively, you can use the `bls function init` command to initialize a new local project:

```sh
bls function init
```

### Help

To see a list of available commands, you can run the `bls` or `bls help` command:

```sh
bls help
```

You can also use the `-h` or `--help` flag after any command or subcommand to display usage information. For example:

```sh
bls function -h
bls function init -h
```
